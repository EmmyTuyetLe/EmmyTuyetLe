### HeyðŸ‘‹ - I'm Emmy Le

## I am currently self-learning programming! My goal is to be a fullstack developer. I have over 10 years of work experience in the field of statistics and data analytics. I have always had a love for solving problems and finding the answers to things, so programming always appealed to me! If I don't know the answer to something, I at least know how to find the answer.
